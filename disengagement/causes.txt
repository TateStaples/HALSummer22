3 - Weather(Cloudy): Driver's decision to takeover because ego vehicle was braking on a sign in the middle of a pedestrian crossing considered as a pedestrian, perception issue
6 - Discrepancy in planning around vehicle merging from pulled over position in highway shoulder close to ego car
5 - Weather(Sunny): The vehicle moving irregularly due to poor/bad lane detections where white lane mark background is painted in black color on US-101 Freeway,  No unusual conditions were observed, within ODD
4 - Weather(Cloudy): Driver's decision at stop intersection because the strategy missed a front object and thus seen it too late to be considered in the stop queue (bad order of the queue because late detection), perception issue
6 - The AV attempted to go around a vehicle stopped at a Red light. As a result, the driver safely disengaged and resumend manual control.
6 - Planning discrepancy; system planned incorrect yield at intersection due to an oncoming vehicle during right turn maneuver.
6 - Safety Driver disengaged autonomous mode to re-center vehicle in lane.
6 - Precautionary takeover to address prediction; yielding to stopped vehicle
7 - A generalÂ error caused the system to stop the engaged status. Vehicle not in an active construction zone. No emergency vehicles or collisions present in the vicinity. Weather and/or road conditions dry in the area.
6 - Precautionary takeover to address planning; yielding to cross traffic
7 - An issue with environment model caused the system to disengage. The system asked the operator to take control of the vehicle.
6 - Planning; as a precaution, the safety operator intervened for the ADV insufficiently yielding to a vehicle making a protected left turn.
7 - An issue with data recorder caused the system to disengage. The system asked the operator to take control of the vehicle.
4 - Daytime, clear weather, normal street traffic.  Perception issue: orange & white traffic cones sitting in the middle of the vehicle's travel lane were not detected by the software processing the sensor data stream.
4 - The AV didn't detect the obstacle in front of it. As a result, the driver safely disengaged and resumed manual control.
6 - During the lane change maneuver the test vehicle was going the "correct" speed as posted by road signs, but was going too slow or too fast given the traffic and road conditions. Conditions: Non-inclement weather, dry roads, no other factors involved
5 - Weather(Sunny): Car double parked, outside of ODD
7 - Hardware diagnostic caused software kickout
6 - Planning Logic: Incorrect behavior prediction for offroad pedestrian results in unwanted braking
3 - Weather (Cloudy, Light Rain):  Pedestrian crossing post detected in center of roadway, perception issue
1 - Prediction; as a precaution, the safety operator intervened as a vehicle did not follow the appropriate traffic procedures and proceeded straight from a right turn only lane at T-section.
6 - Weather(Sunny): Controls disengaged at pedestrian crossing due to requesting deceleration above threshold, internal safety concept rules
1 - Disengage for unwanted maneuver of the vehicle caused by a control discrepancy in delivering the planned trajectory to the vehicleâ€™s controls system
6 - Planning discrepancy affected chosen trajectory to hit the curb.
5 - Weather(Sunny): Car parked on our lane, outside of ODD
3 - Weather(Sunny): The vehicle stopped/braked in the urban street due to detection of fire hydrant as an object, No unusual conditions were observed
6 - Weather(Sunny): The vehicle braked due to a object merging at higher relative speed, No unusual conditions were observed
4 - Weather(Sunny): Late detection of cyclist transitioning from bike lane to road, perception issue
4 - Weather(Sunny): Controls did not stop vehicle for pedestrian going across crosswalk that intersected left turn, perception issue
6 - Motion plan exceeded speed limit
1 - Weather(Sunny): Oncoming vehicle driving on wrong side of the road, driver's safery decision
6 - Daytime, clear weather, normal street traffic.  Planning issue: The autonomy system attempted to lane borrow around the vehicle in front of it, but was unsuccessful.
3 - Weather(Cloudy): Pedestrian crossing: virtual object blocking ego vehicle when all pedestrians cleared the intersection (strategy issue)
5 - Weather(Cloudy): Driver's decision to takeover too pass a car trying to park in the middle of ego lane, outside of ODD
5 - Safety Driver disengaged autonomous mode to ensure proper behavior at traffic light
2 - An issue with perception component caused the system to disengage. The system asked the operator to take control of the vehicle.
1 - Driver precautionary disengagement due to aggressive cut-in by other vehicle
2 - Weather(Sunny): Loss of one sensor, Hardware failure
1 - Planning; as a precaution, the safety operator intervened for a vehicle that, without warning, cut into the ADV's traveling lane.
