I want you to develop a decision tree that predicts whether a human (called driver, test driver, operator)
disengaged or the AV software disengaged (called AV system/software),
and how the various features (like company, day, location) contributed to this.
You will not need permit number.
You goal is to develop a decision tree visualization like the one here: http://hal.pratt.duke.edu/sites/hal.pratt.duke.edu/files/u35/HAL2019_1.pdf

Your next big step will be translating column I into column J, which we will call "Contributing Factors". You need to figure out how to classify the events in 20 or fewer categories. You could use behaviors like lane drift, improper merge, too slow...or something else.  Then you need to develop clear rules for how you decided which case goes into which category.

This is the most painful part but also the most important! If you are struggling or have questions, let me know and we can jump on zoom.
